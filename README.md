# Algorithms Theory

The focus of the subject is to learn and understand in depth the theory and practical use of some algorithms techniques, such as:
* **Divide and Conquer**
* **Greedy** and their advantages and disadvantages when using them.
* **Dynamic Programming** with some well-known problems, like the Knapsack problem, Subset Sum, etc.
* **Backtracking** and the resolution of the N-queens, K-Coloring, etc.
* **Flow Networks** by the use of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

Also, it introduce the Classes Complexity:
* **P**
* **NP**
* **NP-Complete**
* **NP-Hard**
* **P-SPACE**
